    "National Institutes of Health\u2013Funded Cardiac Arrest Research: A 10\u2010Year Trend Analysis - PMC: Cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming over 450 000 lives annually. Improving survival depends on the ability to conduct CA research and on the translation and implementation of research findings into ... [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]",
    "Latest in Resuscitation Research: Highlights From the 2021 American Heart Association's Resuscitation Science Symposium | Journal of the American Heart Association: Dr Carolyn Zelop (New York University) ... of all developed nations.24 Maternal cardiac arrest requires an understanding of physiological changes during pregnancy and a modified ACLS algorithm to account for the management of 2 patients. Dr Todd Kilbaugh (University of Pennsylvania) presented on mitochondrial function in mediating neurologic outcomes in post\u2013cardiac arrest animal models,25, 26 neurometabolic optical monitoring devices for cerebral metabolism,27 and advanced approaches ...

    "New Developments in Cardiac Arrest Management - PMC: To achieve ROSC, early CPR and defibrillation are critical for survival when a shockable rhythm is encountered. Defibrillation is the best treatment of VF cardiac arrest because with immediate CPR survival rates decrease by only 3% to 4% per minute, whereas without immediate CPR this rate is ...

    "Cardiac arrest - Wikipedia: Sudden cardiac arrest may be treated via attempts at resuscitation. This is usually carried out based on basic life support, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), or neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) guidelines.

    "Most Important Outcomes Research Papers on Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation | Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes: There remain several lacunae, which need to be overcome to develop an effective resuscitation system. For example, the failure to recognize cardiac arrest, low bystander rates of CPR, variation in CPR quality, defibrillator availability and use, EMS response, and variation in quality of ...
