    "Metamathematics - Wikipedia: Metamathematics provides \"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside ... [en.wikipedia.org]",
    "Metamathematics for Systems Design | New Generation Computing: New Generation Computing - This position paper describes the context, the goal, the strategy and the tactics of the ERATO MMSD project (2016\u20132022). The project aims at enhanced quality... [link.springer.com]",
    "Metamathematics - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics: So one task of metamathematics is the construction of formalized deductive theories via the deductive method. Now, as a result of the application of this method \"deductive theories acquire certain interesting and important features\". [Tarski, 1941a, p. [www.sciencedirect.com]",
    "The Physicalization of Metamathematics and Its Implications for the Foundations of Mathematics: Online book by Stephen Wolfram. Results from samplings of the unique ruliad structure that corresponds to the entangled limit of all possible computations. General physicalized laws of mathematics are discussed, associated with concepts such as metamathematical motion, inevitable dualities, ... [www.wolframscience.com]",
    "Metamathematics: Foundations & Physicalization: Book by Stephen Wolfram shows how both mathematics and physics as experienced by humans can be seen to emerge from the unique underlying computational structure of the recently formulated ruliad. [www.wolfram-media.com]"
